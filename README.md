# Python utility to control Spotify from your command line.
Available commands:
- help (you know this already)
- play
- pause
- skip
- next
- previous
- current
- popularity
- louder
- softer
- mute
- unmute
- shuffle
- unshuffle

Mac OS X only.

`spotify.py` runs in a loop.
`cli-spotify.py` is a command line utility, so I can alias it and change Spotify based on command line args.
